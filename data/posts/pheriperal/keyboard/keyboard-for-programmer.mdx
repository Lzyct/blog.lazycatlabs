As programmer, absolutely we need keyboard to write the code ðŸ—¿.

Keyboard is like a part of life for programmer, so you need to find the best and comfortable keyboard.
So, let me introduce my favorite keyboard that I use since 2021's ðŸ”¥

## Unique Layout

The layout of my keyboard is not a conventional design, is called HHKB Layout. The first HHKB Professional was released in December 2003 and is available in either white or charcoal (black) colorways with either blank or printed keycaps. Retroactively known as the HHKB Professional 1, this is the first HHKB model to use the famous Topre electrostatic capacitive keyswitches that all subsequent models use to this day.

The latest version is called HHKB Professional Hybrid and have 2 type, standard and type-s _(silent version)_ ðŸ¤«

They also create JP layout for Japan

## You should use this keyboard!

As you can see, for the layout. Mostly, you never use the `caps lock` button on your keyboard. And the common button you use is `Control`. For conventional design, you need to move down your hand to press the `Control` button or `arrow button`, and for a long time that will make your hand tired ðŸ˜©. HHKB layout is designed for long time use and makes your hands not tired easily ðŸ™ƒ. For the arrow, you can use the button combination `fn+ [` (up) `fn+ ;` (left) `fn+ /` (right) `fn+ '` (down) it's called _diamond arrow_ ðŸ’Ž and for `Backspace` button is more reachable.

## Connectivity

For the hybrid version, you can connect use cable _(type-c)_ or over Bluetooth _(support for 4 devices)_. And also this keyboard use AA battery ðŸ”‹, so you just replace with the new one if the battery getting low. I would recommend to you, to use rechargeable battery. ðŸŒ±

## End Game

For the Keyboard enthusiast, **End game keyboard is a myth** ðŸ‘º. Once you join in the Mechanical Keyboard World, is hard to get out. Because you need to explore more and more to find your end game keyboard. That's why I choose HHKB because need a lot of money ðŸ’¸ if I want to do modification. Last time I buy for the keycaps only it's take about \$112 (include delivery) + tax about \$38 ðŸ¥². I have planned to do my really end game with combine my HHKB with Heavy Grail but I don't know when I do that, because the price of Heavy Grail is expensive [(about $680.00)](https://shop.norbauer.com/products/the-heavy-grail-hhkb-housing) ðŸ¤Œ

## Alternative

But out there, some cherry switch keyboard have use design the HHKB layout. Here some recommended for cherry switch keyboard with HHKB layout
