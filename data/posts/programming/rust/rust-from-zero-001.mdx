summary: 'You should know about it first before going deep into Rust'
---

Before we go too deep, should be good if we understand the basic thing about Rust. As you know, I have a background in other programming Languages (dart, Kotlin, etc). So the `Rust from Zero` it's not from those who never or don't have experience in programming. I make this series to write my progress and also about my understanding when learning a new programming language, especially `Rust`.

## File naming

In Rust files always end with `.rs` extension. If you are using more than one word in your file name, you can use `_` _(underscore)_ to separate them.

> üëçüèª Do

- hello.rs
- hello_word.rs

> üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Don't

- Hello.rs
- HelloWord.rs
- helloWord.rs

## Create new project

In Rust, we have two options to create the project.

### Without Cargo

```bash
mkdir project_name
cd project_name
touch main.rs // create the file main.rs
```

So, if we want to create a Rust project without `Cargo`, we need to create the file and folder manually the first time. But if

### With Cargo

```rust
cargo new project_name
```

We just run that command, cargo will generate automatically the base project with `Cargo` support, which is `Cargo` work as Package Manager in `Rust`

## Write, Compile, and Run a Rust Program

In the `main.rs` if you create your project with `Cargo`, you can open and see the file inside `src/main.rs` should be like this.

```rust
fn main(){
	println!("Hello, LazycatLabs!");
}
```

but if you create it manually you can copy and paste that code into your `main.rs`. And after that, we need to compile the file first

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
```

after you run that command, if you're on Linux, MacOS or PowerShell on Windows you will see the `executable` file

```bash
$ ls
main main.rs
```

But when you are using CMD on Windows, you also will see `main.exe` and `main.pdb`. And then you can run your Rust Program with type this on your terminal.

```bash
$ ./main # or .\main.exe on Windows
```

## Anatomy of a Rust Program

Let's review the main.rs program in detail.

```rust
fn main() {

}
```

These lines define a function _`fn`_ named `main`. The `main` function is special because it's always the **first code that run** in every executable Rust program. In that code has no parameter and return nothing. If we want to add parameter, that parameter should be inside parentheses `()`.

The function body is wrapped in `{}`. Rust requires curly brackets around all function bodies. You can use an automatic formatter tool called `rustfmt` to format your code. And if you're use `IntelliJ Idea` and install `Rust` plugin you can format your code easily and also you can add an external tool to analysis your code

The body of the `main` function holds the following code:

```rust
println!("Hello, Lazycatlabs!");
```

There are 4 important details to notice here.

1. Rust style is to indent with `four spaces`, **not a tab**
2. `println!` calls a Rust macro, I can explain it later because I need to the `Caphter 19` to understand it üòÖ
3. You see the `"Hello, Lazycatlabs!"` string, We pass the string as `argument` to `println!` and the string is printed to the screen.
4. We end the line with semicolon `(;)` which is indicates that this expression is over.

## Cargo

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. Cargo also can build build your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on and build that library.

When you create your project using Cargo like this

```Rust
cargo new project_name
```

That's automatically generate the folder project.

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ src
¬†¬†   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs

```

And when you open the `Cargo.toml` file, you should see this code

```toml
[package]
name = "rust_from_zero"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

You can define what library do you want to use below `[dependecies]` for that example I want to use `rand` library with version `0.8.5`.

In `[package]` you will see the default information generated based on your project name, and you can see here for more keys and their definition in [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).
