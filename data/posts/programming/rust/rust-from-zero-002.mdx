summary: 'Guess game with style'

Hello everyone! In this article, we're about to delve into the implementation of the [Guess Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) in Rust. Our journey through the `Rust from Zero series` closely aligns with the guidance thoughtfully provided in the [official Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Let's embark on this enlightening adventure together!

## Unveiling the Game Flow

Before we dive into the code, let's establish the underlying algorithm and gain a clear understanding of how our application will operate.

The Guess Game, as outlined in the Rust documentation, presently follows an uncomplicated sequence:

1. The user inputs a number.
2. The program attempts to guess the number:
   1. It enters a loop if the guess is incorrect ❌.
   2. The program will be exit if the guess is accurate ✅.

While this simplistic approach serves as a solid foundation, we aspire to infuse our guessing game with enhanced interactivity to heighten the challenge.

Expanding Horizons

By infusing additional elements into our flow, we can elevate the intrigue of our guessing game:

1. Players are granted a limited 5 attempts to unveil the mysterious number.
2. The user provides numerical input.
3. The program endeavors to guess the number:
   1. Should the user's guess miss the mark in all 5 attempts, the user will experience defeat.
   2. In the event of a correct deduction, we graciously inquire whether the user wishes to persevere or gracefully exit the game.
4. Our revamped guessing game now boasts the following options:
   1. An opportunity for the user to engage in another attempt.
   2. A graceful exit for those who choose to conclude their gaming session.

## Let's Dive into the Code!

In this guessing game, we will utilize some essential libraries:

1. `use std::cmp::Ordering;` – an enum used to determine whether your guessed number is less, equal to, or greater than the secret number.
2. `use std::io;` – used for capturing user input.
3. `use rand::Rng;` – this library assists in generating random integers. Remember to add this library to your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

We can create a new file to separate the guess_game function code from `main.rs` is called `guess_game.rs`

```rust
// main.rs

mod guess_game;

fn main() {
	println!("\n============================");
	println!("      Hello, Lzyct!         ");
	println!("============================\n");

	guess_game::guess_game();
}
```

```rust
// guess_game.rs

use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

// make the function pub (public), to make it accessible
// to another file
pub(crate) fn guess_game(){
		// generate a random number from the random_number function
		// make it mutable, we need to update the value if the user
		// choose to play again
		let mut secret_number = random_number();

		// we set attempts is 5 times
		// and make it mutable because we decrease the attempts
		// when the user guesses the wrong number
		let mut attempts = 5;

		// create a loop to make program running
		// until the user chooses to end the game
		loop {
			// this will hold the user input data
			// and need to make it mutable because the value
			// will update every time user inputs the number.
			let mut guess = String::new();

		  // this function will catch the user input and add it into
		  // guess variable
		  io::stdin()
				  .read_line(&mut guess)
				  .expect("Failed to read line"); // end when error we will throw this message

			// shadowing guess variable to convert it from string to u32
			// because cmp::Ordering function need input u32 and also
			// to handle when the user inputs anything other than numbers
			let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().prase() {
				Ok(num) => num,
				Err(e) => {
					println!("{}", e.to_string());
					println!("Please input a number!");
					continue;
				}
			};

			// decrement attempts
			attempts = &attemps - 1;

			// to check guess number and the secret number is matching
			// we can use cmp::Ordering enum which is will return
			// Ordering::Less, Ordering::Equal, and Ordering::Greater
			match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
			    Ordering::Less => {
			        if attempts != 0 {
			            println!("⛔️ Too small!\n⚠️ You have {} attempts left", &attempts);
			            println!("-------------------------------------------------");
			        } else {
					        println!("-----------------------------------");
									println!("You lose! The secret number was: {}", secret_number);
									println!("-----------------------------------\n");
			        }
			    }
			    Ordering::Equal => {
			        println!("------------------");
			        println!("You win! 🎉");
			        println!("------------------\n");

							// reset attempts to show options
			        attempts = 0;
			    }
			    Ordering::Greater => {
			        if attempts != 0 {
			            println!("⛔️ Too big!\n⚠️ You have {} attempts left", &attempts);
			            println!("-------------------------------------------------");
			        } else {
									println!("-----------------------------------");
									println!("You lose! The secret number was: {}", secret_number);
									println!("-----------------------------------\n");
			        }
			    }
			}

			// ask the user if they want to play again
			// if there are no more attempts
			if attempts == 0 {

		    println!("--------------------------------");
		    println!("Do you want to play again? (y/n)");
		    println!("--------------------------------");
		    let mut play_again = String::new();
		    io::stdin()
		        .read_line(&mut play_again)
		        .expect("Failed to read line");

				// catch the user input
		    match play_again.trim().to_lowercase().as_str() {
		        "y" => {
		            println!("\n\n---------------------");
		            println!("Let's play again! 💃🏻");
		            println!("---------------------");

								// generate a new random number
		            secret_number = random_number();
		            // reset attempts
		            attempts = 5;
		            continue;
		        }
		        "n" => {
		            println!("Bye! 👋");
		            break;
		        }
		        _ => {
		            println!("Invalid input!");
		            break;
		        }
		    }
			}
		}
}

// to generate a random number that returns u32
fn random_number() -> u32 {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    println!("The secret number is: {}", secret_number);
    println!("Please input your guess. (integer between 1 and 100)");
    println!("---------------------------------------------------");

    return secret_number;
}
```

## Result

This is the result of the program 🎉🎉🎉
