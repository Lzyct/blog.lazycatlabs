summary: 'Resolve 404 when refresh or direct access specific URL'
---

I got this issue when working on [https://lazycatlabs.com](https://lazycatlabs.com) v2, when I deploy it in the VPS I got this error when I'm trying to refresh [https://lazycatlabs.com/portfolio](https://lazycatlabs.com/portfolio).

`Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (File not found)`

## Background

Before we start, I will explain about my server configuration

So, I do reverse proxy using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) and put my Flutter Web inside Docker. This issue can't reproduce in Development, that's why I just realize when I deploy it and trying to refresh or directly access this URL [https://lazycatlabs.com/portfolio](https://lazycatlabs.com/portfolio).

## Identify the root of cause

As you can see, I get error code `404`, that's mean the browser can't found the assets/file when trying to access [https://lazycatlabs.com/portfolio](https://lazycatlabs.com/portfolio). When you run the Flutter Web in debug mode, Flutter will create a web service and load the web file from `/web` folder, but when you run it in release mode, Flutter will create and load files from `build/web`.

Once the basic web server is activated, the `index.html` page automatically invoke from `Web` folder and will load the assets as well as the `main.dart.js` file which is `main.dart.js` file corresponds to the Flutter web application.

That's mean, if you get access to the `index.html` file, you are `loading the whole application` looks like `Single Page Application`.

## Force direct the URL to /

The error `404` is happened when you're trying to refresh or directly access non-root path in Flutter web because the browser can't find index.html to load the whole application. That's why we need to redirect user request to `/`. In my cases, I use python to run my web server.

```python
from http.server import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
import socketserver

PORT = 8080

class MyRequestHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
def do_GET(self):
if '.' not in self.path:
self.path = '/'
return SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.do_GET(self)

server = socketserver.TCPServer(('', PORT), MyRequestHandler)
print("Serving at PORT : " + str(PORT))
server.serve_forever()
```

Based on that script, the app will be run in port `8080` and will check the `GET` request, if the request does not contain a dot (indicating a file extension), the path is modified to `'/'` (the root path). This ensures that if a file is not specified in the URL, the server will treat it as a request for the root path.

## Conclusions

In some cases, you just need to redirect the user request from a web service based on how you deploy on your App.

If you are using `Apache` you can add this code on your `.htacces` file.

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.html|assets|robots\.txt|favicon\.png)
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^.*$ index.html [L]
```

But if you are using Nginx you can add this on your configuration

```
location / {
  if (!-e $request_filename){
    rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.html break;
  }
}
```
